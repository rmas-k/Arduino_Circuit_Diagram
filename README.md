# 🔌 Arduino Circuit Diagram

This repository contains the circuit design files and Arduino code for a basic smart circuit project.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- Arduino-Circuit-Diagram.pdf – Visual representation of the circuit.
- Arduino-Circuit-Diagram.xml – File exported from the circuit design tool (Tinkercad or similar).
- code.ino – Arduino source code (to be added).

## 💡 Project Idea

This project is designed to control electronic components using Arduino.  
When a specific action is detected (such as motion or a button press), the circuit responds by activating an LED or another connected component. The goal is to demonstrate how sensors and outputs can be used together in an Arduino-based setup.

## 🔧 Components Used

- Arduino UNO  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- LED  
- Resistor (220Ω)  
- Push button / sensor (optional)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The Arduino receives input from a sensor (or button).
2. Based on the input, the Arduino executes a code that controls the output.
3. For example, when the button is pressed, the LED lights up for a few seconds.

## 🧠 Tools Used

- Tinkercad – for designing the circuit diagram.  
- Arduino IDE – for writing and uploading the Arduino code.
